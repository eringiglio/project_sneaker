	discussion of model parameters
	how do we more closely model differential mating success?
	how do the two allele success rates change with allele frequency? 
	how do the two strategies interact?
	
	takeaway: sperm competition, in cases where one female mates with both territorial male and sneaker, is important 
		in that case, who fathers more of her offspring? Say each female has 4 offspring, 2 of which die--who "wins" the mating? 
		note: sneakers tend to have HUGE testicles....
	
	takeaway: harem size is important. 
		if average harem size is LARGER than optimal size:
			male doesn't have enough cognitive/energetic resources to 100% guard all females
			sneaker males can successfully steal matings
		if average harem size is SMALLER than optimal size:	
			probably because too many territorial males in population
			territorial males must compete against each other for limited territory/female attention
			territorial males' biggest competitor: each other. sneakers therefore lower priority, make out like bandits bc not being watched
