	So what is optimal harem size? That's our question.
	Possibility: optimal harem size as a function of females? Kdom/Kf? 
	More likely: some optimal harem size that dominant males can 100% defend from sneakers.
	IF number of females in harems is less than all females:
		sneakers target females who are not guarded
		dom males get away with all matings of females in their harem
	ELSE:
		each sneaker male has SOME chance of success mating with a female
		dom males get rest of matings 
	Sneaker success chance depends on distance from ideal harem size: 
	DISTANCE FROM IDEAL HAREM SIZE FUNCTION: 
		lim f(H) as H goes to 0 = S/D+S
		lim f(H) as H goes to I = some tiny probability P 
			H = harem size				D = # dom males
			I = ideal harem size 		S = # sneak males

	discussion of model parameters
	how do we more closely model differential mating success?
	how do the two allele success rates change with allele frequency? 
	how do the two strategies interact?
	
	takeaway: sperm competition, in cases where one female mates with both territorial male and sneaker, is important 
		in that case, who fathers more of her offspring? Say each female has 4 offspring, 2 of which die--who "wins" the mating? 
		note: sneakers tend to have HUGE testicles....
	
	takeaway: harem size is important. 
		if average harem size is LARGER than optimal size:
			male doesn't have enough cognitive/energetic resources to 100% guard all females
			sneaker males can successfully steal matings
		if average harem size is SMALLER than optimal size:	
			probably because too many territorial males in population
			territorial males must compete against each other for limited territory/female attention
			territorial males' biggest competitor: each other. sneakers therefore lower priority, make out like bandits bc not being watched
